# Texture-Creator
Texture creation tool for unity

## Installation

Download or clone the repository and copie the files into your Asset folder. The tool is then found under Window->TextureCreator.

## Usage

You can select a texture into the Load panel. I keep source textures into a folder. Surce textures can have any size. The value of the different parameters are saved automatically per source texture. Parameters value are save into `Assets/TextureCreator/Save/` and these can be deleted at any point if not needed.

For each panel the texture can be saved using the write button at the top. By default the textures are saved into `Assets/Textures/`. If a material has been created in the Load panel, textures will be automatically assigned to it.
